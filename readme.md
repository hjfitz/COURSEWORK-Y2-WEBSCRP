## Coursework Spec

Your challenge is to create a Configurable Dashboard.

You are to specify and construct this configurable dashboard using a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and (optionally) PHP, and any backing store you desire (e.g. a database).

Example use cases include:
 - in the home (perhaps for helping a family see what the weather will be like, their upcoming schedule, the latest tweets from their friends, etc.), updated at appropriate intervals.
 - in an office (such as the BK first floor, where we have a flat panel for displaying information to staff and visitors).  A combination of live data from the web and various databases, stories from various sources, images and video may all need to be displayed.

Configuration of your dashboard may be achieved by editing config files, or through a Dashboard Editor created as part of your deliverable artifact â€“ this is your choice.

Your task is to show (through your work) the extent to which you have met the learning outcomes for the unit.

The learning outcomes (as defined in the Unit Spec.) are:
1. Identify industry best practices in web application design (e.g. client, server and API layers).
2. Design a contemporary web application using industry best practices.
3. Critically evaluate the design and implementation of web applications.

## Libraries in Mind
- Express and Handlebars
  - Proved to be very helpful with Lilly Hack
- Materialize cases
  - Who needs to design CSS when this library aready does so eloquently.
- Some sort of onboarding library
  - [intro.js](http://introjs.com/)
  - [shepherd](http://github.hubspot.com/shepherd/docs/welcome/)
- SQLITE/MySQL
  - Depends on the size of the file required.

## Requirements and setup
- Because express-subdomain is hacky, you need to set up your hosts file correctly. Assuming you wish to access the application from webscrp.dev:
  - Note: should probably add this as a script in package.json
```bash
echo "127.0.0.1 webscrp.dev" >> /etc/hosts
echo "172.0.0.1 api.webscrp.dev" >> /etc/hosts
```
**THE API WILL NOT WORK UNLESS YOU COMPLETE THIS STEP**
- Firefox and Chrom**ium** are the web browsers that this has been tested to work on.
	- It's been tested on both Ubuntu and Fedora linux.
